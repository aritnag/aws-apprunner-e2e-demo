# Welcome to AWS Apprunner Demo, Simple Rest API built with Spring Boot which then gets deployed to AWS Apprunner

## Introduction

- Authentication with JWT
- Unit & Integration Tests
- Deploying Spring Boot App to AWS AppRunner

- ### `IMPORTANT`

- I did not configure NAT Gateway to avoid extra bills as this is an open source thing.
- If you have security concerns with your app or it's real app, do not forget to put your stack behind a NAT Gateway in VPC Settings.

### How to Run Spring Boot App?

#### Quick Way

- Go to `application.properties` file in spring boot app and fill it with your credentials.

#### What If We have secrets?

- Navigate into apprunnerdemo folder and then, find create .env file.
- Fill your secrets, have a look at `application.properties` it'll give you info about how to reference the secrets.
- Run `export $(cat .env | xargs)` and then, run `mvn spring-boot:run`.
- Optionally, you can run `SPRING_DATABASE_URL=url other-secrets mvn spring:boot run`.
- If you fill the credentials which work, your app should start successfully.
- The connection is tested with AWS RDS so, you can use it confidently.

### How to Run Tests?

- mvn test

### Docker commands

- `docker build -t apprunnerdemo .`
- `docker run -p 8080:8080 -e SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://AWS-RDS-URL:5432/postgres -e SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=postgres -e SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=password apprunnerdemo`
- Note: We'll pass secrets in CI when we deploy, see above.
